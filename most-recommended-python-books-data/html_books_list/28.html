This third edition of Python GUI Programming Cookbook follows a task-based approach to help you create effective GUIs with the smallest amount of code. Every recipe in this book builds upon the last to create an entire, real-life GUI application. These recipes also help you solve problems that you might encounter while developing GUIs. This book mainly focuses on using Python’s built-in tkinter GUI framework. You'll learn how to create GUIs in Python using simple programming styles and object-oriented programming (OOP). As you add more widgets and expand your GUI, you will learn how to connect to networks, databases, and graphical libraries that greatly enhance the functionality of your GUI. You’ll also learn how to use threading to ensure that your GUI doesn't become unresponsive. Toward the end, you’ll learn about the versatile <a href="/moin/PyQt">PyQt</a> GUI framework, which comes along with its own visual editor that allows you to design GUIs using drag and drop features.

Being a senior developer all but requires awareness of how those skills, along with their expected technical counterparts, mesh together through a project's life cycle.  <span class="anchor" id="line-1140"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1141"></span></p><p class="line874">This book walks you through that discovery by going over the entire life cycle of a multi-tier system and its related software projects. You'll see what happens before any development takes place, and what impact the decisions and designs made at each step have on the development process. The development of the entire project, over the course of several iterations based on real-world Agile iterations, will be executed, sometimes starting from nothing, in one of the fastest growing languages in the world—Python. Application of practices in Python will be laid out, along with a number of Python-specific capabilities that are often overlooked. Finally, the book will implement a high-performance computing solution, from first principles through complete foundation. <span class="anchor" id="line-1142"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1143"></span></p><p class="line867"><a class="https" href="https://packtpub.com/application-development/hands-software-engineering-python">Publisher's page</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-1144"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1145"></span></p><p class="line867"></p><hr><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-1146"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1147"></span></p><p class="line867"><a class="https" href="https://packtpub.com/application-development/hands-data-structures-and-algorithms-python-second-edition">Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python - Second Edition</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-1148"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1149"></span></p><p class="line874">Dr. Basant Agarwal <span class="anchor" id="line-1150"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1151"></span></p><p class="line874">ISBN 13: 9781788995573 Packt 398 Pages (October, 2018) <span class="anchor" id="line-1152"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1153"></span></p><p class="line867"><strong>Book Overview:</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-1154"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1155"></span></p><p class="line874">Learn to implement complex data structures and algorithms using Python <span class="anchor" id="line-1156"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1157"></span></p><p class="line874">This book helps you to understand the power of linked lists, double linked lists, and circular linked lists.

NoSQL databases require a new way of thinking about data and scalable queries. Once Mongo queries have been mastered, it is necessary to understand how we can leverage this API in Python's rich analysis and visualization ecosystem. This course will cover how to use MongoDB, particularly if you are used to SQL databases, with a focus on scalability to large datasets. pyMongo is introduced as the means to interact with a MongoDB database from within Python code and the data structures used to do so are explored. MongoDB uniquely allows for complex operations and aggregations to be run within the query itself and we will cover how to use these operators. While MongoDB itself is built for easy scalability across many nodes as datasets grow, Python is not. Therefore, we cover how we can use Spark with MongoDB to handle more complex machine learning techniques for extremely large datasets. This learning will be applied to several examples of real-world datasets and analyses that can form the basis of your own pipelines, allowing you to quickly get up-and-running with a powerful data science toolkit. <span class="anchor" id="line-3095"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3096"></span></p><p class="line867"><a class="https" href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/working-big-data-python-video">Publisher's page</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-3097"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3098"></span></p><p class="line867"></p><hr><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-3099"></span><a class="https" href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-pyspark-video">Learning PySpark (Video)</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-3100"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3101"></span></p><p class="line874">Tomasz Drabas <span class="anchor" id="line-3102"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3103"></span></p><p class="line874">ISBN 13: 9781788396592 Course Length: 2 hours 29 minutes (February 2018) <span class="anchor" id="line-3104"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3105"></span></p><p class="line867"><strong>Video Overview:</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-3106"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3107"></span></p><p class="line874">Building and deploying data-intensive applications at scale using Python and Apache Spark <span class="anchor" id="line-3108"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3109"></span></p><p class="line862">You'll learn about different techniques for collecting data, and distinguish between (and understand) techniques for processing data.

You will also learn why and when functional programming is useful, and why and when it makes programs unnecessarily complex. Explore lambda expressions, which are short one-line functions, and are the purest form of functional programming that Python offers. Next, learn about higher-order functions: functions that accept other functions as argument, or return other functions as return values. In Python, higher-order functions are elegantly supported through decorators. You will also encounter important concepts from functional programming, such as monads, currying, statelessness, side-effects, memoization, and referential transparency; these concepts may initially seem odd to Python programmers, but you will see how they are elegantly supported by the language. In fact, many Python programmers already make use of concepts from functional programming without being aware of doing so. <span class="anchor" id="line-3743"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3744"></span></p><p class="line874">All the videos in this course contain hands-on examples of the introduced concepts. <span class="anchor" id="line-3745"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3746"></span></p><p class="line867"><strong>What you will learn:</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-3747"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3748"></span></p><ul><li>Recognize the value of Functional Programming <span class="anchor" id="line-3749"></span></li><li>Understand the advantages and disadvantages of Functional Programming <span class="anchor" id="line-3750"></span></li><li>Higher-order functions and Lambda expressions (nameless functions) <span class="anchor" id="line-3751"></span></li><li>Error handling in Functional Programming <span class="anchor" id="line-3752"></span></li><li>Understand common functional design patterns, and how these apply to Python <span class="anchor" id="line-3753"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3754"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><a class="https" href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/functional-programming-python-video">Publisher's page</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-3755"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3756"></span></p><p class="line867"></p><hr><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-3757"></span><a class="https" href="https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-machine-learning-scikit-learn-second-edition">Mastering Machine Learning with scikit-learn - Second Edition</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-3758"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3759"></span></p><p class="line874">Gavin Hackeling <span class="anchor" id="line-3760"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3761"></span></p><p class="line874">ISBN 13: 9781788299879  Packt Publishing 254 pages (July 2017) <span class="anchor" id="line-3762"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3763"></span></p><p class="line867"><strong>Book Overview:</strong> <span class="anchor" id="line-3764"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-3765"></span></p><p class="line874">This book examines a variety of machine learning models including popular machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naive Bayes, k-means, decision trees, and artificial neural networks.

Next, the statistical methods of dealing with autocorrelation and non-stationary time series are described. This is followed by exponential smoothing to produce meaningful insights from noisy time series data. At this point, you shift focus towards predictive analysis and introduce autoregressive models such as ARMA and ARIMA for time series forecasting. Later, powerful deep learning methods are presented, to develop accurate forecasting models for complex time series, and under the availability of little domain knowledge.
