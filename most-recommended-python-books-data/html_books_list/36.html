Written by three experts, including one of the godfathers of the field, this is the most comprehensive book you can find. The book is quite technical but the authors do a great job at explaining everything you need to know to get started.</p><p><strong>Book abstract:</strong></p><blockquote>Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning.<br><br>The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.<br><br><em><em>Deep Learning</em></em> can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.</blockquote><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="grokking-deep-learning">Grokking Deep Learning</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2019/02/book2.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Front cover of "Grokking Deep Learning"</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Author</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/iamtrask">Andrew W.

He writes a great <a href="https://iamtrask.github.io/">blog</a>. No surprises on his book making our list. Yes, he's a FloydHub friend. No, we're not biased. We've really loved the first principles approach of learning from the ground up with NumPy. This is probably the best approach you can follow to learn how Deep Learning works behind the scenes. </p><p><strong>Book abstract:</strong></p><blockquote><em><em>Grokking Deep Learning</em></em> teaches you to build deep learning neural networks from scratch! In his engaging style, seasoned deep learning expert Andrew Trask shows you the science under the hood, so you grok for yourself every detail of training neural networks. Using only Python and its math-supporting library, NumPy, you'll train your own neural networks to see and understand images, translate text into different languages, and even write like Shakespeare!

In <em>Reinforcement Learning</em>, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.<br><br>Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy.

Such techniques are widely applied in engineering, science, finance, and commerce. This book is designed for a short course on machine learning. It is a short course, not a hurried course. From over a decade of teaching this material, we have distilled what we believe to be the core topics that every student of the subject should know. In addition, our readers are given free access to online e-Chapters that we update with the current trends in Machine Learning, such as deep learning and support vector machines. We chose the title `learning from data' that faithfully describes what the subject is about, and made it a point to cover the topics in a story-like fashion. Our hope is that the reader can learn all the fundamentals of the subject by reading the book cover to cover. Learning from data has distinct theoretical and practical tracks. In this book, we balance the theoretical and the practical, the mathematical and the heuristic. Theory that establishes the conceptual framework for learning is included, and so are heuristics that impact the performance of real learning systems. What we have emphasized are the necessary fundamentals that give any student of learning from data a solid foundation. The authors are professors at California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), and National Taiwan University (NTU), where this book is the text for their popular courses on machine learning. The authors also consult extensively with financial and commercial companies on machine learning applications, and have led winning teams in machine learning competitions.</blockquote><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="book-of-why">The Book of Why</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.floydhub.com/content/images/2019/02/book7.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>Front Cover of "The Book Of Why"</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Authors</strong>: <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html">Judea Pearl</a>, <a href="http://danamackenzie.com/">Dana Mackenzie</a>.<br><strong>Where you can get it</strong>: Buy on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Why-Science-Cause-Effect/dp/046509760X">Amazon</a>.<br><strong>Categories: </strong>Data Science, AI and Machine Learning.<br></p><p>This is the most controversial book on our list.

His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl's work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been.

In the conventional approach to programming, we tell the computer what to do, breaking big problems up into many small, precisely defined tasks that the computer can easily perform. By contrast, in a neural network we don't tell the computer how to solve our problem. Instead, it learns from observational data, figuring out its own solution to the problem at hand.<br><br>Automatically learning from data sounds promising. However, until 2006 we didn't know how to train neural networks to surpass more traditional approaches, except for a few specialized problems. What changed in 2006 was the discovery of techniques for learning in so-called deep neural networks. These techniques are now known as deep learning. They've been developed further, and today deep neural networks and deep learning achieve outstanding performance on many important problems in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. They're being deployed on a large scale by companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.<br><br>The purpose of this book is to help you master the core concepts of neural networks, including modern techniques for deep learning. After working through the book you will have written code that uses neural networks and deep learning to solve complex pattern recognition problems. And you will have a foundation to use neural networks and deep learning to attack problems of your own devising</blockquote><p></p><p>If books aren‚Äôt your thing, don't worry.
